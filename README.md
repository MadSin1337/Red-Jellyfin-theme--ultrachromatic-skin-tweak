This is basically the chromatic skin from the jellyfin skin manager with red to the max - minus progress bar, i made it smaller and turned it very red, the picture from the login screen is also gone.
I turned the episode counter for series red, the skin did not do that initially
I added the flex wrapper so that you dont have the library carousel, i think that was annoying, now all libraries are on the homescreen initially, added tweaks to it for small phone screens so it looks good there too.
This does not contain any URL leading to custom css files online, like it would if i just used the ultrachromatic skin, so it does not depend on internet when its on your server, but i does not get updated automatically.
